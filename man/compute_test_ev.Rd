\arguments{
\item{X_blocks_test}{\code{list} of numeric matrices. Test data blocks, one matrix
per block, each of dimension \code{n_test × p_b}. All blocks must have the same
number of rows (samples). Column names are used to align named weights/loadings.}

\item{W_all}{\code{list}. Component-wise weight vectors learned in training.
Must be a list of length \code{K}; each element is a block-wise list of length
\code{B} containing weight vectors. If a weight vector is named, it is aligned
to the corresponding block's column names; missing entries are set to zero.}

\item{P_all}{\code{list} or \code{NULL}. Optional component-wise block loadings.
Same nesting convention as \code{W_all}. If \code{NULL} or empty, loadings are
computed from test data when \code{loading_source = "test_ls"}.}

\item{deflate}{\code{logical(1)}. If \code{TRUE} (default), apply sequential
deflation on test blocks between components. If \code{FALSE}, evaluate each
component on the original test blocks without updating residuals.}

\item{performance_metric}{\code{character(1)}. Latent correlation metric:
\code{"mac"} (mean absolute correlation) or \code{"frobenius"} (sqrt-sum-squared).}

\item{correlation_method}{\code{character(1)}. Correlation estimator for score
correlations: \code{"pearson"} or \code{"spearman"}.}

\item{eps_var}{\code{numeric(1)}. Variance threshold for score validity. Block
scores with variance \eqn{\le} \code{eps_var} are considered invalid for the
objective (and are set to zero).}

\item{loading_source}{\code{character(1)} Source of loadings for the rank-1
deflation step used in out-of-sample EV:
\itemize{
\item \code{"auto"} (default): use \code{"train"} if \code{P_all} is available,
otherwise fall back to \code{"test_ls"};
\item \code{"train"}: use training loadings \code{P_all} (strict application of the
trained model; recommended when available);
\item \code{"test_ls"}: compute least-squares loadings on the current test residual
(\eqn{p = X^\top t / (t^\top t)}), yielding a "weights-only" EV diagnostic.
}}

\item{clamp_ev}{\code{character(1)} How to clamp explained variance ratios:
\code{"none"} (default; preserves negative out-of-sample EV as a diagnostic),
\code{"zero"} (set negative EV to 0), or \code{"zero_one"} (clamp to [0,1]).}

\description{
Computes prediction-side diagnostics for a fitted MB-sPLS model on a set of
test blocks. For each component \eqn{k} and block \eqn{b}, the function:
\itemize{
\item projects the (optionally deflated) test residual block
\eqn{X^{(k-1)}_{b,\mathrm{test}}} onto the trained weight vector
\eqn{w^{(k)}_b} to obtain a test score \eqn{t^{(k)}_b};
\item computes a prediction-side latent correlation (MAC or Frobenius)
between block score vectors \eqn{t^{(k)}_b};
\item computes explained variance (EV) on test data as a \emph{sum-of-squares
(SS) reduction} induced by applying the rank-1 deflation step
\eqn{X \leftarrow X - t p^\top}.
}
}
\details{
\strong{Explained variance definition (out-of-sample SS reduction).}
For each block \eqn{b} and component \eqn{k}, EV is computed on the current
residual matrix as:
\deqn{\mathrm{SS}_{\text{exp}}^{(k,b)} =
      \|X_{b,\mathrm{test}}^{(k-1)}\|_F^2 -
      \|X_{b,\mathrm{test}}^{(k)}\|_F^2,}
where
\deqn{X_{b,\mathrm{test}}^{(k)} =
      X_{b,\mathrm{test}}^{(k-1)} - t_{b}^{(k)} (p_{b}^{(k)})^\top.}
The reported \code{ev_block} values are \emph{incremental} EVs:
\deqn{\mathrm{EV}_{k,b} = \mathrm{SS}_{\text{exp}}^{(k,b)} / \|X_{b,\mathrm{test}}^{(0)}\|_F^2.}
Cumulative EVs (\code{ev_block_cum}, \code{ev_comp_cum}) are obtained by
accumulating SS reductions across components and dividing by the \emph{original}
test SS.

Because this is a true out-of-sample measure, incremental EV may be
\emph{negative} (the deflation step increases SS on new data), unless you
clamp values via \code{clamp_ev}.

\strong{Deflation behavior.}
If \code{deflate = TRUE} (recommended; matches training), components are applied
sequentially and the test residuals are updated after each component.
If \code{deflate = FALSE}, each component is evaluated on the original test
blocks; in that case, \code{ev_block} and \code{ev_comp} are marginal SS
reductions for each component applied in isolation, and cumulative EVs may
not represent a true cumulative reconstruction.

\strong{Loadings source.}
The deflation/loading vector \eqn{p_b^{(k)}} is chosen by \code{loading_source}:
\itemize{
\item \code{"train"}: use the supplied training loadings \code{P_all} (aligned
to test columns by name when available);
\item \code{"test_ls"}: recompute loadings on the current test residual via
least squares,
\eqn{p = X^\top t / (t^\top t)},
yielding a "weights-only" EV diagnostic (note this uses test data to
estimate \eqn{p}).
}
If \code{P_all} is \code{NULL} or empty, the function automatically falls back
to \code{"test_ls"}.

\strong{Latent correlation (MAC/Frobenius).}
For each component, the function computes pairwise correlations between block
score vectors \eqn{t_b^{(k)}} using \code{stats::cor} with
\code{correlation_method}. Blocks whose score variance is \eqn{\le} \code{eps_var}
are treated as invalid for the objective: their scores are set to zero and they
are excluded from the MAC/Frobenius aggregation.
\itemize{
\item \code{performance_metric = "mac"}: mean absolute correlation
\eqn{\langle |r| \rangle};
\item \code{performance_metric = "frobenius"}: Frobenius-style norm
\eqn{\sqrt{\sum r^2}} over valid block pairs.
}

\strong{Global EV across blocks.}
\code{ev_comp} and \code{ev_comp_cum} are computed by summing SS reductions across
blocks and dividing by the summed original test SS. This is SS-weighted; large /
high-dimensional blocks can dominate the global EV.
