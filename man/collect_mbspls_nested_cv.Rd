\title{Collect and summarize results from MB-sPLS nested CV Batchtools jobs}
\usage{
collect_mbspls_nested_cv(ids = NULL, reg)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{A vector of job IDs corresponding to the completed outer fold jobs.}

\item{reg}{A \code{batchtools} registry object returned by
\code{mbspls_nested_cv_batchtools()}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{results}: A data.table with the results from each outer fold.
\item \code{c_mats}: A list of the tuned C* matrices from each outer fold.
\item \code{inner_scores}: A numeric vector of the best inner cross-validation
scores from each outer fold.
\item \code{payloads}: (optional) A list of the full payloads from each outer fold
(if \code{store_payload = TRUE} was set).
\item \code{summary_table}: A data.table with summary statistics across all outer folds.
}
}
\description{
This function collects and summarizes the results from the
MB-sPLS nested cross-validation jobs that were submitted to the
Batchtools registry. It gathers the results from each outer fold,
including the final model performance metrics and the inner cross-validation
results. It also computes summary statistics across all outer folds.
