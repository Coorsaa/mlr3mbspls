\usage{
mbspls_extract_bootstrap_means(
  model,
  component = 1,
  filter_method = c("ci", "frequency"),
  filter_level = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A single mbspls model containing $weights_boot_draws and $weights.}

\item{component}{Integer LC index (e.g., 1).}

\item{filter_method}{One of c("ci","frequency").
\itemize{
\item "ci": keep features whose CI is >= 0 or <= 0.
\item "frequency": keep features with selection freq >= filter_level using model$weights_selectfreq.
}}

\item{filter_level}{Numeric threshold:
\itemize{
\item if filter_method == "ci": confidence level in \verb{(0,1)}, default 0.95.
\item if filter_method == "frequency": minimum freq in \verb{[0,1]}, default 0.5.
}}
}
\value{
A tibble with rows (block, feature) that pass the filter, including
mean, ci_low, ci_high, and freq (if available), sorted by block and |mean| desc.
