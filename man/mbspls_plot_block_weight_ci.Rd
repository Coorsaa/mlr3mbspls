\title{Plot LC block weights with 95\% CIs from a GraphLearner (or legacy inputs)}
\usage{
mbspls_plot_block_weight_ci(
  x,
  source = c("weights", "bootstrap"),
  ci_filter = c("none", "excludes_zero", "overlaps_zero"),
  top_n = NULL,
  add_block_rule = TRUE,
  font = "sans",
  alpha_by_stability = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either:
\itemize{
\item a trained GraphLearner built with \code{mbspls_graph_learner()} (recommended), or
\item a list like \verb{list(mbspls = <pipeop or state>, mbspls_bootstrap_select = <pipeop or state>)},
or your previous \code{c(glearner$model$mbspls, glearner$model$mbspls_bootstrap_select)}.
}}

\item{source}{One of c("weights","bootstrap").
\itemize{
\item "bootstrap": uses aligned summaries from selection state (\code{weights_ci} + \code{weights_selectfreq}).
\item "weights"  : aggregates across multiple MB-sPLS fits (means + Wald CIs).
}}

\item{ci_filter}{One of c("none","excludes_zero","overlaps_zero").
\itemize{
\item "excludes_zero": keep if (ci_low >= 0 | ci_high <= 0) AND |mean| > 1e-3.
}}

\item{top_n}{Integer or NULL. Keep top-N features per block×component by |mean|.}

\item{add_block_rule}{Logical; thin rule between block facets (default FALSE; safe implementation).}

\item{font}{Character; font family (default "sans").}

\item{alpha_by_stability}{Logical; for source="bootstrap", map bar alpha to selection frequency.}
}
\value{
ggplot object (all components facetted in columns)
}
